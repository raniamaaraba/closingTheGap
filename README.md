# closingTheGap

Idea is to create an application to help Gen Z in particular, understand the Lord, how they are poisoned by Big Pharma, and how to heal their health and not become dependent on opiods and other drugs.

The American Psychological Assoication reports that 91% of Gen Z from ages 15-21 have reported "at least one physical or emotional symptom because of stress, such as feeling depressed or sad (58 percent) or lacking interest, motivation or energy (55 percent)." Similarly, they have also reported since 2020 that 129.6% of girls and an overall 63.5% increase have started taking antidepressants to help with these emotions. The issue? These drugs that are being given to children and young adults are destroying not only their health, but also their reproductive system and mental health as well. Depending on the drug (although generalised for most) users often report irritable states, lack of appetite, insomnia, lack of performance (with developing ED and other such), serotonin syndrome, destroyed mental state, enhanced stages of manic states, weight gain, nausea, just to name a few. In the case where you come to understand that these addictive drugs do more harm than good, you can then become affected by discontinuation syndrome as many of these drugs work by changing the chemical balance in your brain. These symptoms are electric-like shocks to the brain (imagine your leg falling asleep but it occurs for weeks in your brain), nausea, fatigue, anxiety, GI bleeding, cardiovascular effects, seizures, thoughts of suicide and self-harm, and many more. 

### Jeremiah 46:11 Reads
"Go up to Gilead, and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt! In vain you have used many medicines; there is no healing for you."
In many states as well, kids younger and younger are being prescribed these medications without the knowledge of how these drugs are damaging themselves--but without being informed of an alternative, how can you blame them? 

## how Closing the Gap comes into play
Closing the Gap allows user to submit their current diagnosis and combat their ADHD, OCD, Depression, Birth Control Medications, and Anxiety based on Biblical remedies that **_actually_** can solve an issue WITHOUT damaging their body, health, and mental state. They are provided with real, long-term solutions that are not quick fixes to improve their diet and help them live with their condition. _It is important to know these conditions may always persist but may decrease with the help of natural remedies and life changes._ The implementation of the UI and the website could help solve serious chronic illnesses where previously people believed there was no alternative than the one they have been fed by doctors. 

# Design Process

<img width="1682" height="693" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-22 at 21 37 27" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c50804d-e5c1-42d5-853b-2f861473cc98" />


## Home Page
<img width="779" height="556" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-22 at 21 37 39" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e3d98ca-0f15-457f-be19-41bf0d2840c3" />
The home page is reminiscient of a blog, but I also want it to be a tool for those who aren't exactly interested in taking the quiz to be able to look at the research and learn more about herbal medicines or quickly be able naviagte to their ailment remidies. A prominent part of this still should be the Word of the Lord--specifically focusing on verses about medicine and caring for the body. The main sector will (hopefully) shuffle through recent articles and have the dynamic sidebar after the user takes the quiz to links for their ailments. 

<img width="1001" height="457" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-22 at 21 37 46" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b10f7688-cc12-46e9-a7ae-90bac71d8094" />
Taking insparation from https://theslowlivingguide.co.uk/ , I wanted this bottom part to be an extension of quick access in additon to the sidebar for research, herbs, and such. Having images with pictures to help describe the actions the user is taking can help them navigate the page before fully utilising the tool.

### Dictionary
<img width="846" height="416" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-22 at 21 38 15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f49a80f-d89c-4630-adec-9a702e43dfd3" />
With my current scope and time frame, it is unrealistic to be able to hit every single illness plaging Gen Z and beyond, leaving the herbal dictionary to help users navigate their ailment without current articles and advice to lean on. Many herbs have qualities to overcome lots of conditions and some niche ones specifically used in drugs like antidepressants (take St. John's Wort for example) and with a quick external search the user can help with their ailment. In future development, like mentioned on the side pannel, I would love to have more indepth articles for each herb.

## Treatment Page
<img width="874" height="746" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-22 at 21 50 09" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80294862-179d-4b0a-9727-15966bde40e4" />
This page is going to be the main meat and potatoes of the material the user will be looking for. This is where I will go over the current drugs on the market, their effects, and what the take is on modern medicine in The Bible. Next, it will go through the natural remedies, lifestyle, and versage. Majority of the information for what the user should be taking away from their illness should be coming from this page. It is critical as well to see what is in the natural remedies--a popularised philosphy since the modernisation of food and medicine has been _'if you cant pronounce it then you cannot eat it'_, which is what I would like to show here. Knowing exactly what is going in and out of your body is critical not only for the sake of your health but also to identify if there are any irratators in your routine. 

### Research
<img width="785" height="388" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-22 at 21 37 58" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/872cfd43-2fe5-4beb-9007-f60892325eaa" />
Many people believe in the power of modern medicine due to the amounts of reasearch (whether valid or falsified), it is important to know the knowledge of our ancestors and how that still holds up till today. This will include my person research for these articles but I believe it is important to note **_many of these remedies have been around for centries before the invention of modern medicine, so why did we stop?_**

### Design
<img width="760" height="322" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-22 at 21 38 25" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb08b098-dd20-4d03-a523-6693d2dce0e2" />
Many modern Bibles (typically NIV) use very etherial and sunset reminiscent color themes which I would like to implement as well to help put the user at ease. This is a place without judgement, lies, and a place where you can relax and learn with the Lord. 

## Quiz of Illnesses
<img width="881" height="408" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-22 at 22 05 05" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/793a1b36-5286-4e93-8b34-a96337564425" />
To help better reccomend and start on a good foot with the user, there will be a short quiz section to help assure the user they are in a safe space with the Lord and they are taking their very first steps in their healing journey. The quiz is primarily used to reccomend articles to the user for a start as well as dynamically update links on the side pannel of the home page

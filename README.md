# closingTheGap

Idea is to create an application to help Gen Z in particular, understand the Lord, how they are poisoned by Big Pharma, and how to heal their health and not become dependent on opiods and other drugs.

The American Psychological Assoication reports that 91% of Gen Z from ages 15-21 have reported "at least one physical or emotional symptom because of stress, such as feeling depressed or sad (58 percent) or lacking interest, motivation or energy (55 percent)." Similarly, they have also reported since 2020 that 129.6% of girls and an overall 63.5% increase have started taking antidepressants to help with these emotions. The issue? These drugs that are being given to children and young adults are destroying not only their health, but also their reproductive system and mental health as well. Depending on the drug (although generalised for most) users often report irritable states, lack of appetite, insomnia, lack of performance (with developing ED and other such), serotonin syndrome, destroyed mental state, enhanced stages of manic states, weight gain, nausea, just to name a few. In the case where you come to understand that these addictive drugs do more harm than good, you can then become affected by discontinuation syndrome as many of these drugs work by changing the chemical balance in your brain. These symptoms are electric-like shocks to the brain (imagine your leg falling asleep but it occurs for weeks in your brain), nausea, fatigue, anxiety, GI bleeding, cardiovascular effects, seizures, thoughts of suicide and self-harm, and many more. 

### Jeremiah 46:11 Reads
"Go up to Gilead, and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt! In vain you have used many medicines; there is no healing for you."
In many states as well, kids younger and younger are being prescribed these medications without the knowledge of how these drugs are damaging themselves--but without being informed of an alternative, how can you blame them? 

## how Closing the Gap comes into play
Closing the Gap allows user to submit their current diagnosis and combat their ADHD, OCD, Depression, and Anxiety based on Biblical remedies that **_actually_** can solve an issue WITHOUT damaging their body, health, and mental state. They are provided with real, long-term solutions that are not quick fixes to improve their diet and help them live with their condition. _It is important to know these conditions may always persist but may decrease with the help of natural remedies and life changes._

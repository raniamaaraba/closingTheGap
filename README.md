# closingTheGap

## Final Deployment: https://closingthegap.netlify.app/

Idea is to create an application to help Gen Z in particular, understand the Lord, how they are poisoned by Big Pharma, and how to heal their health and not become dependent on opiods and other drugs.

The American Psychological Assoication reports that 91% of Gen Z from ages 15-21 have reported "at least one physical or emotional symptom because of stress, such as feeling depressed or sad (58 percent) or lacking interest, motivation or energy (55 percent)." Similarly, they have also reported since 2020 that 129.6% of girls and an overall 63.5% increase have started taking antidepressants to help with these emotions. The issue? These drugs that are being given to children and young adults are destroying not only their health, but also their reproductive system and mental health as well. Depending on the drug (although generalised for most) users often report irritable states, lack of appetite, insomnia, lack of performance (with developing ED and other such), serotonin syndrome, destroyed mental state, enhanced stages of manic states, weight gain, nausea, just to name a few. In the case where you come to understand that these addictive drugs do more harm than good, you can then become affected by discontinuation syndrome as many of these drugs work by changing the chemical balance in your brain. These symptoms are electric-like shocks to the brain (imagine your leg falling asleep but it occurs for weeks in your brain), nausea, fatigue, anxiety, GI bleeding, cardiovascular effects, seizures, thoughts of suicide and self-harm, and many more. 

### Jeremiah 46:11 Reads
"Go up to Gilead, and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt! In vain you have used many medicines; there is no healing for you."
In many states as well, kids younger and younger are being prescribed these medications without the knowledge of how these drugs are damaging themselves--but without being informed of an alternative, how can you blame them? 

## how Closing the Gap comes into play
Closing the Gap allows user to submit their current diagnosis and combat their ADHD, OCD, Depression, Birth Control Medications, and Anxiety based on Biblical remedies that **_actually_** can solve an issue WITHOUT damaging their body, health, and mental state. They are provided with real, long-term solutions that are not quick fixes to improve their diet and help them live with their condition. _It is important to know these conditions may always persist but may decrease with the help of natural remedies and life changes._ The implementation of the UI and the website could help solve serious chronic illnesses where previously people believed there was no alternative than the one they have been fed by doctors. 

# Design Process
Created in Figma
<img width="1682" height="693" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-22 at 21 37 27" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c50804d-e5c1-42d5-853b-2f861473cc98" />


## Home Page
<img width="779" height="556" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-22 at 21 37 39" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e3d98ca-0f15-457f-be19-41bf0d2840c3" />
The home page is reminiscient of a blog, but I also want it to be a tool for those who aren't exactly interested in taking the quiz to be able to look at the research and learn more about herbal medicines or quickly be able naviagte to their ailment remidies. A prominent part of this still should be the Word of the Lord--specifically focusing on verses about medicine and caring for the body. The main sector will (hopefully) shuffle through recent articles and have the dynamic sidebar after the user takes the quiz to links for their ailments. 

<img width="1001" height="457" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-22 at 21 37 46" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b10f7688-cc12-46e9-a7ae-90bac71d8094" />
Taking insparation from https://theslowlivingguide.co.uk/ , I wanted this bottom part to be an extension of quick access in additon to the sidebar for research, herbs, and such. Having images with pictures to help describe the actions the user is taking can help them navigate the page before fully utilising the tool.

### Dictionary
<img width="846" height="416" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-22 at 21 38 15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f49a80f-d89c-4630-adec-9a702e43dfd3" />
With my current scope and time frame, it is unrealistic to be able to hit every single illness plaging Gen Z and beyond, leaving the herbal dictionary to help users navigate their ailment without current articles and advice to lean on. Many herbs have qualities to overcome lots of conditions and some niche ones specifically used in drugs like antidepressants (take St. John's Wort for example) and with a quick external search the user can help with their ailment. In future development, like mentioned on the side pannel, I would love to have more indepth articles for each herb.

## Treatment Page
<img width="874" height="746" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-22 at 21 50 09" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80294862-179d-4b0a-9727-15966bde40e4" />
This page is going to be the main meat and potatoes of the material the user will be looking for. This is where I will go over the current drugs on the market, their effects, and what the take is on modern medicine in The Bible. Next, it will go through the natural remedies, lifestyle, and versage. Majority of the information for what the user should be taking away from their illness should be coming from this page. It is critical as well to see what is in the natural remedies--a popularised philosphy since the modernisation of food and medicine has been _'if you cant pronounce it then you cannot eat it'_, which is what I would like to show here. Knowing exactly what is going in and out of your body is critical not only for the sake of your health but also to identify if there are any irratators in your routine. 

### Research
<img width="785" height="388" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-22 at 21 37 58" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/872cfd43-2fe5-4beb-9007-f60892325eaa" />
Many people believe in the power of modern medicine due to the amount of reasearch (whether valid or falsified), it is important to know the knowledge of our ancestors and how that still holds up till today. This will include my personal research for these articles but I believe it is important to note **_many of these remedies have been around for centuries before the invention of modern medicine, so why did we stop?_**

### Design
<img width="760" height="322" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-22 at 21 38 25" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb08b098-dd20-4d03-a523-6693d2dce0e2" />
Many modern Bibles (typically NIV) use very ethereal and sunset reminiscent color themes, which I would like to implement as well to help put the user at ease. This is a place without judgment, lies, and a place where you can relax and learn with the Lord. 

## Quiz of Illnesses
<img width="881" height="408" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-22 at 22 05 05" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/793a1b36-5286-4e93-8b34-a96337564425" />
To help better recommend and start on a good foot with the user, there will be a short quiz section to help assure the user they are in a safe space with the Lord and they are taking their very first steps in their healing journey. The quiz is primarily used to recommend articles to the user for a start as well as dynamically update links on the side panel of the home page

# Final Version
## Home Page
<img width="1489" height="749" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-09 at 21 55 40" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e422805-c56c-463b-b5a3-5b400d63700d" />
Very similar to the sketches, I added a lot more depth than I had originally planned for with the home page. I wanted it pretty to the point so you are shown verses to help remind your of the times that the Lord sees you through and overall navigation to all the other main pages. I personally really love the ombre effect on each of the sectors. I will say a big issue for improvement off the bat is the images; I am not sure if it is the size but they dont quite sit right. One big change I had to remove from the original sketch was the article sector due to the way I had set up how the articles work (along with the dynamic quiz to link you to articles) since they are all technically on the same page.

## Directory
### Ailments
<img width="1497" height="757" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-09 at 21 55 47" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07c405dd-5e34-4e06-8dc8-5c6d6da79e85" />
There are too many conditions for me to be able to go indepth and teach the user about their current medicine and natural alternatives so I created a catch all witha list of the most common used tinktures for users to be able to scroll through and find a possible solution. They are also able to use the search bar to look by condition or if they possibly had a tinkture in mind. These are quick and short descriptions. 

### Verses
<img width="1495" height="758" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-09 at 21 55 57" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ade217a7-f4e8-47ea-b032-4aa0604f1a8e" />
I also wanted a place where the user was able to be able to read verses that were from the Bible about medicine if they wanted a quick pick me up or to really see why this app was created in the first place. Similarly, you can search by the book from the Bible.

### Resources
<img width="1494" height="754" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-09 at 21 56 22" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1a88703-35ee-4e74-bd73-16ea4eed27fa" />
Majority of the sources I have listed at the end of the README were more for the preface of this page--a lot more resources were required when going into writing the articles. This is also a comprehensive list of all the books and articles that I have used. Each is accompanied with a link to the article, a short description of what its purpose is, as well for books, a link to purchase if necessary.

## Side Bar Navigation
This bar is the key to the main content of the web app.
### Quiz Feature
<img width="1509" height="756" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-09 at 21 56 34" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59182b32-10d6-4adb-8187-df6dc16bc2d3" />
My goal with the quiz was to be able to introduce new users that were curious about how the app worked and was looking into potentially natural remeides to be able to have quick and easy guidance. However, with the way I ended up setting things, this works more as a quick stop for TLDRs. Based on the user's responses about their current condition, what their current remedies are, and what they are seeking, they are given quick notes about how to follow up in that scenario. For this quiz, where the user expressed concerns about their anxiety and wanted natural remedies, they were given a list of tinktures and balms to try out as well as a follow-up article to be more in-depth. 

### Articles
<img width="1504" height="755" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-09 at 22 21 08" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be69e15e-2876-457d-8c28-e076208f5e9a" />
Truly the meat and potatoes of the whole app, I'd like to believe. This is where truly the user can dig their heels into whichever topic they desire to learn the evil ways of Big Pharma alongside God's word and natural treatments. Currently, I tried to focus more on Gen Z and hit topics relevant such as anxiety and depression, OCD, ADHD, birth control, and bipolar disorder. Each article has a custom thumbail for the article with a curated verse for the Lord's take.  
<img width="1512" height="753" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-09 at 22 21 31" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59830e4d-ee55-4776-b3ca-16dd3029e49b" />
When you first open the article--you are listed with what are the current drugs (not actually pictured in this picture), how those drugs are affecting your body and in most cases, actually making them worse than without the drugs, and then the actual other options. Ailments for each illness are truly dependent on more than just the things you consume but also your lifestyle and environment, so as much as I could, I tried to emphasise this. 
<img width="1515" height="754" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-09 at 22 21 43" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07922761-536e-4482-8620-85eb06e7d891" />
There are also safety precautions listed for each alternative option since many herbs are the natural form of what is derived in the synthetic drug and could cause issues with any prescription medication that could be emulating the herb. Since there are many verbs littered around the site, I truly don't go overly in-depth but would love in the future to almost discuss this verse like it is a Bible study or from a sermon. There is also a quick bullet point section at the bottom as a TLDR.

### Herbal Dictionary
<img width="1504" height="760" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-09 at 22 20 34" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e42d2b3a-048f-448d-9196-05dc1d733d6b" />
Similarly to the ailments, I wanted a catch all be all for herbs for those who truly want to go more in-depth into the herbal lifestyle. Incorporating herbs into your diet and lifestyle alongside your treatments can truly make a large impact for all parts of your body. Majority of the herbs are the most common and largely effective herbs with each providing a short description, what they are used for, and possible allergens. Truly, I believe the only downside of herbal treatments tend to be the allergens for anyone who has seasonal allergies and more specifically, any weed allergies. Sometimes, based on the family, you will not always necessarily be allergic to the related herb but it is best to be wise with your dosage and intake. 

## Future Improvements
Although I have talked about improvements here and there throughout each section, I wanted to as well quickly hit some points. One of the big things is the articles and recommendations. As many believe that herbal medicine is ineffective and similar to a placebo, there isn't always a lot of research on each topic and possible alternatives. A lot of the current tinktures and salves and more generalised to quick healthy fixes to symptoms rather than overal the condition. I would love to be able to dedicate more time to researching this as well as alternative therapies that could be used in conjunction with the traditional therapy. I would also love to be able to get the featured and reccomended articles to display based on the user's feedback from results or which articles they frequent often. The search bar as well on the main page needs to be better implemented as for now on the main page (it works on every other page) it just is more for future aesthetic purposes rather than functionality.
